//Code snippet for Built-In Type Methods, page 34-35 Up & Going

var a = "hello world";
var b = 3.14159;

a.length;			//built in property - displays a characteristic.  i.e. 11 characters long
a.toUpperCase();	//built-in method - changes to allcaps
a.toFixed(4);		//built-in method - outputs STRING of #'s rounded to 4 decimal places' -> "3.1416"

//See notes from Jan 12 for discussion of object wrappers.  Need to review this concept again later.
